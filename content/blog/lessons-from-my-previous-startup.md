  I've learned from it.

Last year in August 2020, I started working on a chrome extension called [Chummy](https://chummy.atomiccode.io) that brings an IDE-like experience to Github. I'd initially put together some scripts to address my own pain points with the platform, but I seriously started thinking about productizing it when I had a handful of tools that I thought others could benefit from. 

Chummy became a labor of love that took 6-7 months of time I found between lunch breaks and after my 9-5 job. At times it consumed my life, and sometimes I went a few weeks not working on it because I'd gotten tired of the idea.

Here's a few things I'd do differently if I had to do it again:

### I'd launch at one month in. 

I barely had a product at the 1 month mark, but I had something that I could get feedback on. I spent way too much time making sure the colors were right, setting up a cd/ci pipeline that I'd use twice, setting up CDN to deliver gzipped files that I ended up scrapping, and other meaningless tasks that took up too much time. 

I realize that I kind of agonize over the details that don't matter, and sometimes

### Get a lot of feedback earlier.



### Iterate quicker.



### Document the process!
