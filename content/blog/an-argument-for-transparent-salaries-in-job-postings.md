Which got me thinking... why isn't this a thing in the first place? When I'm on the hunt for jobs, one of the most important parts of the job posting is the salary. Team fit, work culture, work-life balance, benefits, and more are very important things to consider when applying to jobs, but the thing that often lacks the most transparency is the M O O L A H. As shallow as that sounds, it's the reality of working to pay the bills and keep a roof over your head. For some, this might not be a concern, but it's not hard to admit that this is a top priority for many looking for work. 

## Companies vs. Candidates: A tale as old as time.

Why aren't companies transparent about salaries? Companies may feel like disclosing any number puts them at a disadvantage when it's time to negotiate. Albeit an outdated but ubiquitous mindset, the first person to speak loses. There is also the concern that a high paying job will attract large numbers of unqualified people. However the bigger concern is that the most qualified candidates will skip your job posting if they don't see a convincing number.

What do we, the candidates, hate about job postings without salary ranges? We don't want to sink a chunk of time into the application and interview process for a job that we can never accept (some applications take an hour or more to fill out). We are more likely to settle for underpaying jobs because job hunting fatigue is real which may cause retention chaos.

While salaries have traditionally been left out of the equation, more and more companies are committed to making compensation a more transparent and unbiased process. [Gitlab does an especially good job!](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-calculator/#sf-benchmark) 
Providing transparency starting with the hiring process shifts the conversation away from money towards career development, ultimately expediting the hiring process and setting a good foundation for the candidate's trust in the company over the long run.

## #OpenSalaries

This is why I feel particularly passionate about empowering candidates. Pieter of @levelsio started this movement called #OpenSalaries to push companies to be more transparent about their salaries. And it's working with sites like [remoteok.io](https://www.remoteok.io) that empower digital nomads.

I strongly believe that both companies and candidates can benefit from this transparency. Well-intentioned companies want high quality candidates and well-intentioned candidates want high quality jobs. Money is kinda the way we value things in society, and salary seems like an accurate enough barometer. So how about we put our money where our mouth is and own this movement!
